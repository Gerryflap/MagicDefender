# Magic Defender
Trying out Godot by creating a tower defense game. Currently work in progress.

The game is inspired by the prompt "Magic gone wrong" and builds on the following mechanic:

- It is a tower defense game
- You acquire "magic" (or something) as a resource to build
- The resource buildings that acquire magic also slowly corrupt the world
- There's a tradeoff here, with buildings that generate more magic for the same cost, but also disproportionally corrupt the world way more
- Corruption will cause a larger number of enemies to spawn, as well as spawning stronger enemies earlier
